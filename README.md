## Overview of the analysis.


-  Analyse temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, to make an informed business decision.

-  Use new tools such as SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to build on your knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods. Write and execute Python code in a Jupyter notebook and create graphs using Python.
   

### Results:

1- *Both June and December have high temperatures to support ice cream sales*

High temeratures in both June as well as December means that the business can operate year-round regadless the sasons.


2- *Even though there is no seasonality, June is a hotter month and other indicators can be used to determine the sustainability of the business model*

-   However we see that all other indicators such as mean, std, min etc. suggest that the difference between June and December is negligible. As such the model provides even further reassurance that this is a year-round business.


3- *Considering that June and December which are the peak of summer and winter, indicate souch minimal temerature differences, the other months differences are even lower. Thus actually stregthens the business model.*

-   The difference in temperature in the months between June and December are even lower. Overall the temerature risk of this business is almost inexistent.



# Summary:

-   Based on the results, the temperature differences, supported by other indicators too, for June and December, provide strong evidence that theere is no business risk in temeratures accross different months. Temperatures are high throughout the year and the business is not effected by sesonality. This is a year-round business. More information can be provided as below:
